# DFIR TEMPLATES

Hi All,

Since there is so many amazing people creating incredible DFIR tools, I thought I'd focus on the thing everyone hates DOCUMENTATION. Will be updating Incident Response documents
and procedures to help you get those pesky reports done and take notes quickly and efficiently. Always appreciate any feedback

If you need ideas please check out the DFIR 102 powerpoint for the full presentation from GrrCon 2022!
